# Squid Game DSA Project (C++)

This repository contains my **3rd Semester Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) project**,
inspired by the Squid Game theme.

The project focuses purely on **logic and problem solving** using DSA concepts.
As per **course and instructor requirements**, **no game visuals or graphics** are included.

##  Important Note
This project was developed strictly according to **academic guidelines**.
No graphics, animations, or visuals were used, as instructed by the course teacher.
---
##  How to Run
1. Open the project in **Code::Blocks**
2. Compile the `.cpp` file
3. Run in console
